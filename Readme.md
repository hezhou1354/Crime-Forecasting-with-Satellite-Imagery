# Crime Forecastin with Satellite Imagery

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to forecast likely places of future crime

scenes, that is, to predict when and where a certain crime type

will occur, using past data. [Stalidis et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/3/4/46) presents a detailed

study on crime classification and prediction using deep learning

architectures. [Najjar et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06764.pdf)  attempts to predict crime rate directly

from raw satellite imagery and presents a proof-of-concept study

on predicting crime rate from raw satellite imagery. Motivated by

these two papers, this project hopes to study crime classification

and prediction with the additional support of satellite imagery.
